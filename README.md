# Manga Reader
A free and open source modern manga reader based on NextJS to read manga from a Tachidesk-Server Instance.

Manga Reader needs to connect with an already hosted server.

**This is an extremely thin client used to only read downloaded mangas.**
You'll have to use other clients for stuff like manga management & discovery.

So why build this??
## Features:
1. Search your (horny) mangas by genre tags. *bonk*.
2. Clean user interface and user experience.

# How to start
1. ```bash npm run build```
2. ```bash npm run start```
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

*Docker container in the future*
